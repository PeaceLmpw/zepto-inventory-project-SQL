# zepto-inventory-project-SQL
A sql project for beginners that expoire an inventory project with sql

- Zepto Inventory Analysis
This project is a beginner-level SQL project aimed at exploring and analyzing the Zepto Inventory dataset from Kaggle. The focus is on learning and practicing core SQL skills by querying a realistic dataset that involves inventory records, orders, customers, and transactions.

- Project Overview
Zepto Inventory provides transactional and product data typical of an inventory management system. This project guides the workflow from raw data to insightful conclusions using SQL queries only.

- Dataset Description
It provides an opportunity to apply SQL concepts such as filtering, grouping, and database normalization.
The primary data file is provided in CSV format (zepto_v2.csv) and a SQL script (zepto_inventory.sql) contains the schema and initial queries.

- Key Learning Objectives
Set up and understand relational tables and their relationships.
Perform SELECT queries to extract specific data based on conditions.
Group, and summarize inventory and sales data.
Analyze inventory levels, sales trends, etc.
Gain confidence in writing SQL for real-world business data.

- Project Workflow
Data Exploration
Review the dataset structure and fields using basic SQL queries.

Schema Creation
Use the provided SQL script to create tables and populate data for Zepto Inventory.

- Querying Practice
Write and test queries to answer business questions, such as:
Which products have the highest sales?
What are the most popular categories?
How is inventory distributed across warehouses?
Identify top customers by purchase volume.

- How to Use
Import the zepto_v2.csv dataset into your preferred SQL environment or use the zepto_inventory.sql file to build schema and load data.
Run the sample queries or create your own queries to explore the dataset.
This repository serves as a learning sandbox for beginner SQL practitioners.

- Requirements
Basic knowledge of SQL and relational databases.
SQL engine or environment such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any SQL IDE that supports importing CSVs and executing SQL scripts.

- Acknowledgments
Dataset sourced from Kaggle’s Zepto Inventory challenge.
Inspiration for building this beginner-friendly project to develop SQL querying and analytical skills.
